								<p>My name is Shariq Raihan, and I am a passionate individual born in the vibrant city of New York in the early 2000s. Growing up in the city that never sleeps, I was surrounded by a melting pot of cultures, which is a testament to my diverse and rich background.</p>
								<p>I come from an immigrant family, and my upbringing has instilled in me a deep appreciation for hard work, resilience, and the pursuit of the American dream. Witnessing my parents' journey has fueled my drive to excel in my educational and professional endeavors.</p>
								<p>From a young age, I was captivated by the world of technology. Living in an era marked by rapid technological advancements, I embraced the digital age wholeheartedly. This early exposure fostered a curiosity that would later lead me down the path of data science.</p>
								<p>Growing up, I spent hours playing various sports and video games with my sibling and cousins. These activities not only provided a source of entertainment but also instilled a sense of healthy competition, pushing me to strive for excellence in everything I do.</p>
								<p>I proudly became the second individual to graduate from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor's degree. The journey was filled with challenges and triumphs, shaping my character and determination, and providing me with experiences I will forever be grateful for.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of Rhode Island, and I am excited to delve deeper into the field of data science. My passion for working with data stems from a desire to uncover meaningful insights and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.</p>
								<p>My overarching goal is to channel my passion for data science into impactful contributions within the medical or sports field. Motivated by a desire to merge analytical skills with a profound impact on human well-being, I aim to leverage data-driven insights to enhance healthcare outcomes or optimize athletic performance. While my primary aspiration lies in these specialized domains, I am open-minded and enthusiastic about exploring diverse data science opportunities. I believe that the versatility of data science can transcend industry boundaries, and I am eager to contribute my skills and insights wherever they can make a meaningful difference.</p>
